# Fluidity
Javascript 2D Fluid Simulator

Functionality MVP List:

+ Be able to influence movement of fluid with the mouse cursor, changing the velocity of the fluid cells.

+ User can inject the fluid with density that will change the movement of the fluid. 

+ Show two fluids with different parameters interacting with one another.

+ Implement gravity so fluid has a realistic look inside the container.

Wireframe: 

+ Still in the works


API + Technology:

+ p5.js will be used to create vector objects which come with methods that make vector math easier, such as dot products and finding magnitude. 

+ CanvasHTML top render the simulation inside of a 1000 * 1000 px container.
